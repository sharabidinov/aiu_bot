Event bot
===
Telegram bot, that takes and saves event data.

The main code is in handler.py/personal_action.py
There we have all the so called 'handlers', which create all the commands, that bot can execute. 

Install packages from requirements.txt and paste bot token inside config.py :)

To **boot** the bot, you only need to run 'bot.py'.
